Ampliato CartoPins

formerly exo-addon-cartopins
___


  
**Ampliato CartoPÃ¬ns** is an [eXo Platform] add-on, developed by [Ampliato], built using [Juzu Framework] as a bridge to [Portlet][1] technology. Since eXo is built upon [JBoss GateIn Portal], this software runs gracefully in GateIn, as an addon too. 

___
#### General Purpose 
The main goal of this project is allow you render and search (using ajax) geographic SQL data inside [OpenStreet Maps] using [Leaflet] library. So:

* Ampliato CartoPins is a portlet developed using Juzu Framework.
* It's written in Java, using only two template views: one for EDIT mode and other one for VIEW mode.
* It runs inside eXo Platform (tested on community version - 4.0.{6,7,8}) and JBoss GateIn (tested on 3.{5,6,7,8}.0, )
* It's controlled by a single class, that provides both view mode above.
* It connects to database backend using JDBC driver. It works with different database providers.
* It's very configurable, enabling you to define your own SQL queries, just exposing your data using some pre-defined columns.
* It allows you perform search into your data domain, using Ajax requests, and multiple criteria searches simultaneously.
* It allows you to render colored pins in maps. It's up to you define your pins colors.
* It allows you to render 1:N related data, for each of your pins. The data is displayed inside Leaflet ballons.
* It allows you to define a period for auto-refresh your map and your pins.

We have a YouTube video illustrating everything that's documented over here.

#### Example of Use
This example of use is about displaying some ficticious customer's accounts into map and the currently monthly sales target, in a time frame scope. It allows you to search your data by vendor, account, region, city, state and other domain-oriented attributes.

######Install
To install this addon just drop the war file (target folder) into your container "webapps" folder. Watch the log expecting the auto-deploy behavior. Open your container's site on browser, and go to Administrator preferences, specifically into "Applications" sections. Categorize the Ampliato CartoPins addon by your own.

######Placeholder
Into any of your's portal page, edit it, and place this addon wherever you need, by searching it on the previous defined category.

######Configurations
Click on preferences in page edit mode, and go to Portlet Edit tab.

Here's some references about preferences:


* ``Latitude``, ``Longitude``, ``Zoom``: settings about the inicial zoom and position of where your map should be centered.
* ``Refresh Time``: Seconds to count before try to refresh your current map data.

* ``Driver``: The JDBC Driver class instanced to estabilish a conection. **DO NOT FORGET TO PUT JDBC DRIVER JAR INTO LIB's CONTAINER FOLDER**
* ``Host``, ``Port``, ``Database``, ``Username``, ``Password``: Credentials and information about where your data is located. Your host must be an IP or a hostname reacheable by your portal server network.
* 
* ``SQLQuery``: The query that should be executed, following the query structure below:


*Query Structure*

The following columns list must be avaliable on your query, exactly on this order and using exactly the respective datatype.

* ``VARCHAR`` ``'name'``: The associated display name for pin. (e.g.: account 1)
* ``VARCHAR`` ``'count'``: The associated count for pin. (e.g.: Target: 0.00%)
* ``VARCHAR`` ``'lat'``: The Latitude for pin. (e.g.: -23.4912811)
* ``VARCHAR`` ``'lng'``: The Longitude for pin. (e.g.: -47.4412726)
* ``VARCHAR`` ``'color'``: The color associated for pin. It must be a 6-digit hex color. (e.g. #aaaaaa)
* ``VARCHAR`` ``'tokens'``: A comma-separated string, that will be used to search your pins. (e.g.: industry,sao paolo,brazil)
* ``VARCHAR`` ``'children'``: A comma-separated string, that will be used to split (line feed) details about your main entity. The search engine will deploy this list in search mechanism too. (e.g. invoice items list, 1:N details about an occurence)


**IMPORTANT**: eXo and GateIn portals force "Edit Mode" tab to hide "Save and Close" button if you define a custom EDIT view, which is our case. So, when changing addon preferences, do not forget to click first on save, and then on close button. The only way I found to put them together (as an "save and close button) is placing some generic configurations defined in portlet.xml file. But this just prevent some custom features, as the "Test Connection" button, for example, otherwise you could implement your own preferences validator instead, which does not allow our "Test Connection" button.

After define your preferences, certify yourself that you connection's parameters are ok, clicking on "Test Connection" button. That will execute a "SELECT 1" on your database backend.

Save your preferences (Save and then Close). Save your portal's page, and refresh your main page. You now will be able to see a map and your pins rendered. If something goes wrong, check the portal's log file. Ampliato CartoPins is very verbose about logs.


######Search data
Try to execute some searches on your data domain. Ampliato CartoPins allows you to separate concepts of search into tokens, comma-separated. It will search inside you ``tokens`` and ``children`` dataset columns.

For example, if you search something like "industry,brazil", Ampliato CartoPins will try to match against tokens and childrens ``industry`` **OR** ``brazil``, giving you a powerfull search mechanism.


#### Considerations

This project has some considerations and premises about using it, presented below.

######GEOCODE YOUR DATA
This project has as a premise you already have [geocoded] [2] you data. Geocoding data is a pretty simple process, but in a 99.9% of cases involves costs and licences about rendering the same geocoded data into maps, and that's the reason of this premise. For lucky, there are some vendors that can help you to geocode you own data. They are:

* [Google Maps] [2]
* [CloudMade] [3]
* [GeoCode.US] [4]
* [GisGraphy] - An opensource tool that merges data of OSM and GeoNames
* [HERE.COM]
* [MapQuest]


######MAKE YOUR QUERY RUN QUICKLY
Because this addon is ajax powered, it is intented to search your data on a server side, and this search occurs without telling your database that your are actually searching. In other words, it works just looking for data in the Java server container. Beside this, your server must refresh you data periodically (it's a settting), and the results must return fast. So, to reach this, materialize your data into views, or replicate your complex data query into a phisical tables, and then, configure this addon to search this materialized view/table.

######DO NOT USE TONS OF RESULTS
Leaflet render pins as DOM elements, on demand, synchronously. Given that, try to assembly your query to fetch just some few result, when few means hundreds of results. That enable users to make quick searches and reduces the ammount of server processed data, as the data trafficked between your browser and your server.


####Development
Learn here how to develop, build, deploy and test this project.

######Learning
If you reach this project, and just does not know what a Portlet is or even what Juzu is, just take a look at this nice posts:


* There is some interesting material [here] [5], [here][6] and [here][7].
* [Juzu Reference Guide] [8]


The development flow of this addon actually is hosted into our's Gitlab instance. This code is just a stable mirror of the project, so, do not expect recent activity in the code.

######BUILD PROCESS
The build process is quite simple, since the project is managed by maven and ``pom.xml``.

git clone https://github.com/Ampliato/exo-addon-cartopins.git and

mvn deploy
